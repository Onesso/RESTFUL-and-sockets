# Description
NOTE: this is a describtion of how to build a backend with Prisma as (ORM) and socket (for real time communication) using javascript as the language, Express.js and the database is MongoDB.


# initialize and set up the project
app.js in the main application for my backend; it is the file that is going to run the express app

initialize (install) node js to our project: npm init -y

in this code we will be using module types, not ("type": "commonjs",) so that the imports will look like this: (import a from B)

install express to the project: npm install express
This will install node_modules and package=lock.json into our application dir.

Create a .gitignore file and add nodules there

# create and start the server

on app.js import , create an express app and listen to a port
